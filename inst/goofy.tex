\def\Ncdf{\Phi}
Suppose $Z$ is a test statistic which under the null hypothesis is $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, and under the alternative hypothesis is $N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$, with $\sigma^2$ and $\mu$ unknown.  The critical value is $z_{1-\alpha}\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.
The power is $\bar\Ncdf(\sqrt{n}(z_{1-\alpha}\sigma/\sqrt{n}-\mu)/\sigma) =\bar\Ncdf(z_{1-\alpha}-\sqrt{n}\mu/\sigma)$.  
Let $Q$ be the $1-\beta$ quantile of the alternative distribituion.
The distribution function under the alternative distribution is 
$\Phi(\rtn(z-\mu)/\sigma)$.
If the test of size $\beta$
Test has power $1-\beta$ if $1-\beta$ quantile of under alternative is the 
$1-\alpha$ quantile under null.
Let $Q=\rtn z_{1-\alpha}/\sigma=$.
